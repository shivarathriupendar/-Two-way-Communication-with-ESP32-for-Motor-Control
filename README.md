# Two-way-Communication-with-ESP32-for-Motor-Control
This project enables two-way communication between two ESP32 modules via WiFi. The server reads a potentiometer value to control a servo motor, while the client receives this data for monitoring or further use. 

Ideal for remote control, IoT, and robotics applications.
## Objective
To demonstrate two-way communication between two ESP32 modules using WiFi, where one ESP32 reads analog input from a potentiometer to control a servo motor, and the second ESP32 receives and processes this data remotely. This showcases real-time remote control using simple hardware and WiFi.
#  Electronics Used
2 × ESP32 Dev Boards

1 × Servo Motor (e.g., SG90 or MG996R)

1 × 10K Potentiometer

Jumper Wires

Breadboard (optional)

External 5V Power Supply (for servo, if needed)

# Project Focus
To design and develop a WiFi-based embedded system that highlights reliable peer-to-peer communication, real-time sensor data acquisition, and actuator control using ESP32 microcontrollers. The project serves as a foundational model for IoT, automation, and wireless control applications.

## Outcomes
Real-time servo motor control based on remote analog input.

Established peer-to-peer WiFi communication using ESP32 (AP + STA modes).

Demonstrated integration of analog sensing, PWM control, and data transmission.

Scalable solution for applications in IoT, robotics, and remote automation systems.
