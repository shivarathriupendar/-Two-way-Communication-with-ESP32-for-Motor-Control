# Two-way-Communication-with-ESP32-for-Motor-Control
This project enables two-way communication between two ESP32 modules via WiFi. The server reads a potentiometer value to control a servo motor, while the client receives this data for monitoring or further use. Ideal for remote control, IoT, and robotics applications.
